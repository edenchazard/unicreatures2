These aren’t just simple blocky containers – in general, eggs waiting to hatch prefer a little more than that, and larger creatures, even more.  \r\n\r\nThe Darian Corporation, based in Old City, at the heart of technological innovation, took to this need and put their not inconsiderable expertise into building habitats for undersea creatures.  Caretakers who lived further from bodies of water especially took advantage of these habitats – Anex could Melody could stay closer to home if they wanted, and the habitats even usually had wheels so they could visit the oceans every so often.\r\n\r\nWhile the habitats were already widely used by caretakers, the Darian Corporation didn’t rest and somewhere in their experimental underwater environments, something happened.  Perhaps the sea creatures wanted more, or maybe it was the technology itself, but the engineers started to find that the habitat had extended, with fish able to make their way out in bubble-like structures.  It took some time for them to realize the bubbles were actually sentient and capable of growing, but when they did, they dubbed this new creature Darini.

(6, 'Old City', 150, 'Like any major metropolis, New Atlantis has been expanded and rebuilt countless times. Entire parts of the city have been abandoned, forgotten, reclaimed and restructured. This has led to a second city, located under the ground of New Atlantis. This place is called Old City, and many unique creatures make their home there.', 'gemstone', 'stone; supplies'),
(7, 'Red Sand', 200, 'Far from the mainland, almost on the other side of Esmelda, lies the island of Red Sand. Red Sand, so named for the bright red color of its earth, is a highly magical place and the veil between the spirit world and the material world is thin here. Red Sand offers a wide variety of creatures, some who are not unlike their mainland cousins, and others who look strange and wondrous indeed. Caretakers who set foot on Red Sand quickly fall in love with this land and its wonderful creatures, and many believe that the island, with its strange red earth, is the living heart of Esmelda. Only caretakers who have a deep and true understanding of their unicreatures and through them, Esmelda, can reach Red Sand. To all others, the island is like a mirage, always fading on the horizon.', 'spirit_stones', 'wood; stone; metal; supplies'),
(8, 'Life Tree', 250, 'At the heart of Silva Forest stands the massive Life Tree, dwarfing mountains and the already impressive Silvan trees. From its branches hang a myriad of different seeds and botanists often speculate that Life Tree was the first tree on Esmelda, with all other trees descendant from it. What most do not know is that the Life Tree is a sentient creature that once partnered with Jody DeSilva (even this legendary caretaker would not dare to say she \\"owned\\" Life Tree, preferring to see their relationship as a partnership instead).\n\nThe Life Tree is so vast that most human minds cannot comprehend it as only one tree, which is why it is often referred to as "The Treetops." And indeed, the treetop is where most activities go on in Life Tree. Whilst the bottom of each leaf radiates light, providing the layer below it with the light needed to grow, the canopy is so dense that living there is difficult. As the leaves at the base and top of the tree are a little less dense, most creatures live in one of these two places, with most of them preferring the treetop.', 'tree_seeds', 'wood'),
(9, 'Cloud City', 300, 'High above Esmelda, almost in a different world, rises Cloud City. Held afloat with amazing steam technology, its high-domed buildings with elegant spires rest on rocks amidst the clouds. To the casual onlooker, Cloud City is all brass, copper and steam. More dedicated visitors quickly discover it''s so much more than that. Cloud City is a way of life that permeates everything, right down to the way its inhabitants see, feel and think. It''s about making the impossible possible, elegant beauty combined with raw power and above all, it''s about passion for new experiences.\n\n			Cloud City is one of the few places where one can encounter dwarfs outside their underground halls and while the other dwarfs consider them ''old fashioned,'' their applications and discoveries in the field of steam technology astounds even the high-tech inhabitants of Old City.\n\n			There are many ways into Cloud City, but the brass ornithopter (an amazing ride even if it crashes - and there''s a fifty percent chance it will!) and stepping stones leading from Life Tree are the most popular by far. So welcome and enjoy your stay in Cloud City: even the sky is not the limit here!', 'mystic_dew', 'metal; supplies'),
(10, 'Skyland', 350, 'To the West of Cloud City lies Skyland, a series of floating islands high above the ground. Scholars studying the history of Esmelda believe that Skyland and Cloud City were once part of one enormous continent held aloft by thermal winds. For reasons yet unknown the continent shattered into thousands of smaller islands that slowly drifted apart on the currents.\n\n			The islands of Skyland are eclectic and strange. Some float so high above the ground that they’re covered in permafrost, whereas others are visited by warm winds that create an eternal summer. Few people make their home on Skyland as, apart from the zeppelin service to and from Cloud City, there is no transport system connecting the islands – anyone wanting to explore here must do so under their own power.', 'spirit_stones', 'wood; stone; metal; supplies'),
(11, 'Hephland', 400, 'Hephasteus, the well-known owner of New Atlantis Plaza, is the richest man on Esmelda by far. The fee he asks for distributing eggs to and from the Plaza is minimal: just enough to cover expenses and build a small reserve in case transportation costs go up. Over the years, however, the reserve kept building until it became a big reserve. Huge, actually. Not wanting to simply keep the money for himself, Hephasteus started thinking of other ways to use it. Finally he decided on Hephland: a place where Caretakers AND creatures can go to relax.\n\n			Hephland lies on one of the most Southern points of Skyland, just barely extending over Red Sand. It is housed on one of the biggest floating Islands – not counting Cloud City, of course – and can safely hold thousands of visitors at a time. Hephland is divided into three parts: an amusement park, a resort area and Hephasteus'' mansion. The amusement park features every known ride, in addition to several of Hephasteus'' own design, whilst the resort offers every possible luxury. The mansion is Hephasteus'' home when he''s not in New Atlantis, though most of it is open to visitors too. It consists of a huge house with grounds, a swimming pool and tennis court. All in all, Hephland is everything anyone could want for a wonderful vacation.', 'tree_seeds', 'wood; stone; metal; supplies');

As you write, the components beside you start to dissolve, glittering in the air like snow.  It would be nice to enclose photos too, so you fetch a packet of them. Your intent to sort fades until you''re just looking through them and as you become lost in your memories, you feel the brush of a ribbon against your cheek and look up to see a Julian egg perched on your shoulder.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

As you reflect on your goals and think of how to accomplish them, your components start to dust, forming a bubble around you, and you find yourself in a lake.  Old City gleams overhead, distorted through the water.  A flash of red and black catches your eye and you glimpse a little egg determinedly swimming to shore. You follow it and it races out of reach but you keep trying and once it''s on shore, it waits just long enough. When you pick it up, you find yourself back home, Capricorn egg hiding in your shirt.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),
(35, 'Reality Manifested', 'Harnessing the essence of reality itself, this spell calls forth a powerful Relity egg.', 5, 'creature', 259, 1, 'With trembling hands, you add the components to the stone egg you carved. Each component you use is valuable, containing the essence of life on Esmelda itself. When you''re done, you softly imbue the egg with your breath, calling it to life. The stone becomes softer, yet somehow more solid and real. You smile as you realize that the spell worked - you''ve succesfully consolidated reality into this precious egg.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

It shines iridescent and when you read the spell, it shimmers turquoise. You see a goat-shaped cloud nearby and with the bowl carefully in hand, you follow it up to the top of the nearest mountain. You tip the bowl and strangely, the water doesn''t fall down, but up, leading to a fluffy cloud above your head.  A strange symbol glows from within the cloud and then the teal stream spins around you, both cloud and water disappearing. The bowl you brought with you is transformed, and an Aquarius egg sits happily within its circumference.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

Once they are, you recite the words and pour the bucket over your head.  When you shake the water from your eyes, you find yourself in an inlet by a stairway that leads deep into the water.  Two Aquarius study you carefully before they let you pass. You follow the staircase down, straight into the deep water, but with every step you take, you seem to be immersed in more than water.  It''s not a staircase into water after all, but one into another world. Right at the last step, you find a Pisces egg flickering before you.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),
(38, 'Fireside Audience', 'Consult a magical fire that may lead the caster to an Aries egg.', 5, 'creature', 315, 1, 'You think these directions look oddly straightforward, but you burn the ingredients and wait until the fire roars before whispering the incantation.  The fire seems to snap and burn brighter until a symbol manifests in the flames.  You study the symbol and it''s not until the fire snaps a second time that you jump and remember to ask for an egg.  The fire seems to consider your request for a moment before an Aries egg jumps out of the fire, landing squarely in front of you.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

Crushing the components together, you boil the starweave and treescent until the stew turns turquoise.  When you add the ancientberry, it turns brown at first but you wait until it''s emerald.  Sprinkling the bluemaple on top, you wait for the potion to cool and bring it out to a patch of earth.  You pour it in the shape of the designated symbol and wait.  Slowly, flowers creep from where you the mixture met the earth and when they flourish, you see a Taurus egg waiting for you.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

You take care to hang them in the clearing in two neat rows and stand between them to whisper the incantation.  The spell paper''s whipped away by the sudden swell of wind but you stay still, and you find yourself caught between two opposing gusts of wind. The chimes clash loudly, but you think you hear voices.  They''re discordant at first but you think they''re trying to find a harmony; finally, they mesh into a tune, and you find Gemini eggs tightly bound together in front of you.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

When it does, it turns red and you dip the stones in.  They''re translucent when you pull them out, and you set them about the room, adjusting the light so the entire area glows red.  Setting out a bowl of water, you sit in front of it and recite the spell, then close your eyes to wait patiently.  Finally, you hear a small splash and when you open look, you see a Cancer egg testing the water with a little leg.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

There, you set up the metal so it catches the sunlight and focuses it onto the pile of components.  You whisper the words and after some time, they seem to catch alight.  It''s blindingly bright but you try not to hesitate, and follow the next step, putting your hands in the light.  You feel a weight land abruptly in your palms and when you pull them back, you see a Leo egg resting, its tail twitching eagerly.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

First, you reorganize your books, magazines, and letters; you end up needing to build a few new shelving units, and try to make room for them.  Afterward, once the clutter''s gone, you start cleaning.  It takes you a few hours, but at the end, everything looks spotless. There''s a surge of magic by the components and you feel like you''re being watched; when you turn, you see a Virgo egg perched atop one of your brand-new shelving units.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

As you lay out the base and work your way up, you think about how much you want to summon this egg, but of course, you recognize it''ll make you busier too.  Soon, a tall triangular shaped structure tapering to a very narrow point rests before you and when you step back, you see a Libra egg balancing at the very top, its chains jangling while it watches you with interest.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),
(50, 'Solitude', 'Take a day to yourself to call a Scorpio egg.', 5, 'creature', 437, 1, 'You take your components and go to the most secluded area by the water that you can find.  Kneeling at the water''s edge, you drop the components in and recall the words of the spell, reciting them out loud.  The water stops running, growing still and deep.  You look into the suddenly murky depths, and your thoughts drift to how you were before, and the new insights you''ve garnered since.  It takes a moment for you to notice the glow in the water, and the forceful presence beneath the surface. You reach into the water and pull out a Scorpio egg.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

You don''t follow the directions exactly, but you go where your creativity takes you, arranging the ingredients.  When you''re done, you light a match and it ignites, fire entering the maze and blazing forward like it has a mind of its own.  It rails against the stone boundaries and you wonder if it''ll reach the center, but decide to be patient.  In the end, the flame takes a twisted path, but roars when it reaches the center.  The light shifts purple and when it dies down, you find a Sagittarius egg in the embers.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

When you finally have your circle made, you pull out the rest of your things. You put the dried Essentia twigs in the circle then place your pile of moonrubies on top. You use the torch to light the twigs then sit back and think about all your current friendships. One by one, their faces appear in the flames.  The moonrubies began to melt and lava starts to bubble up from the ground.  When it dries, it crumbles away to reveal a Garnet egg.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

Mounted on the bow is a bowl that looks like a turtle shell - inside, burns incense made from powdered components. The fragrance is light and dreamy. You place a Time Warp Watch in the bowl and watch as the smoke grows like rolling fog. Vague shapes form just out of view, a few of which look familiar, like things you know you''ve seen in dreams. You see something that is almost tangible and reach out yo grab it. An Amethyst egg. Upon that realization, the smoke clears and you find yourself once again back in the waking world.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

Fortunately, this spell eliminates the need for any diving skill. Since all Aquamarines are masculine, the primary ingredient of this spell is the Male Gen-X Potion. Before the magic happens, you must first thoroughly grind the other ingredients with mortar and pestle, then mix with waters from the Old City caverns (the purest waters found on Esmelda, by the way). Heat carefully, boiling until the components dissolve and the mixture is crystal-clear; add the Gen-X potion. The magic of Esmelda simulates the chill of the caverns deep underground without having to be there, and somehow through that magic, as the mixture cools, inside your cooking pot coalesces a perfect Aquamarine egg!', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

Dipping your pen into the magic ink, you begin to draw. Concentrating, you draw several complicated glyphs. As you stretch your cramped hand, wondering if you drew them properly, the glyphs begin to glow. The light grows brighter and brighter.  When it fades, you find a large crystal sitting before you. Slowly, it begins to crack and its once flawless surface is now filled with hundreds of hairline fractures. The crystal explodes in a glittering rain of light and now before you is a shining Diamond egg.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

Finding a suitable building foundation, you build a small stone pyramid as suggested in the secret recipe. To obtain the proper brilliant green hue, you mix the Whiteroot with the Watervine, then carefully fold in the highly prized Ancientberries and Essentia. Slathering this concoction over the pyramid, you wait patiently; nothing happens. Re-reading the recipe desperately, you notice some previously overlooked small print. “The secret word is ‘Smeralda’!” You close your eyes and prayerfully mutter this strange word.

Eventually, you sense a single byte of data that has decided to go against the flow. Capturing this maverick “seed,” you surround it with the requisite components and then freeze all of the materials with the Cryogenic Spray. Soon, almost subliminally, you sense a constant, soothing hum emanating from the materials. Daily the hum grows louder until one day you see that a crack has formed in the frozen mass and a soft pinkish light is seeping out. Carefully peeling off the outer shell, you are thrilled to uncover a lustrous Pearl egg!', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),
(60, 'Lead to Gold', 'An alchemical formula used to create a Bastet egg.', 5, 'creature', 452, 1, 'Walking into Hephasteus’s alchemy lab, you fire up the burner, eager to get started. You spread the parchment on the table, gathering the needed supplies from the shelves. Carefully, you combine the powdered components and add the Gen-X. You place the beaker of components on the burner, stirring until it’s a rolling boil. When it’s done, you pour the liquid over several small pieces of lead. They melt together, and then slowly start stretching as it comes to life. You place the sunnyseed in the middle of the mass and it wraps around the seed, forming into the shape of an egg. When it’s all over, a golden Bastet egg sits before you.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),
(61, 'Up, Up and Away', 'Learn to observe to summon a Ruby egg.', 5, 'creature', 541, 1, 'The instructions were simple: "Find the highest place you can and observe."  What better place than an Old City hover balloon?  Looking out across Esmelda, you see a large group of Manos honing their electroreceptive sense.  Some Flamencos fly by and land, starting an intricate dance routine with a bunch of Lamiels.  A herd of Relity gallops though the sand dunes of Red Sand, kicking up a cloud of dust.  Suddenly, you realize you''re not alone.  A furry Ruby egg has appeared next to you, seemingly watching with you.  When the music and dancing end, you take the balloon out of hover mode and start the journey home.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

You spread out notebooks and half-completed models, shaking your head.  Suddenly, a small glitter of light flits outside your vision - it''s there, and then it''s not.  The light continues bouncing around and you watch, mesmerized by its seemingly random movements.  Looking at your things again, you can see all the inner workings of your invention; feverishly, you record your thoughts and complete the model. You sit back, looking at the work that had stumped you for months, and smile. The tiny pebble-sized light comes to a stop atop your model, and you realize it’s a Peridot egg.', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

It speaks to you; it is part of who you are. It calls your name whether you are at the water’s edge or miles inland. One particularly sunny day, you find yourself irresistibly drawn to the edge of the Sargasso Sea. Standing barefoot as the waves lap and the sand shifts beneath your feet, you observe the clouds on the distant skyline. There''s one that looks like an Echo!  That one near it looks positively Brody-esque; what fun!  A strange movement beneath your feet draws your attention. How did that Sapphire egg get there? You thought they were native to Old City!', 99, '1970-01-01', '1970-01-01', 2099),

Inevitably, however, even you occasionally yearn for the feeling of the sun, wind and rain on your face.  A particularly changeable Esmeldan day seems perfect for your "walkabout," and you set out for a pleasant walk in the rain. As the rain tapers off, the sun breaks through and warms everything around you. Ahead of you appears a rainbow. You notice a young Patrick sitting near the rainbow’s end with a pot of something in front of him.
